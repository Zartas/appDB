	<p><?php echo Config::getVal('general', 'site_name'); ?> can only be successful as a link source if it becomes the main, community-respected place to get and submit links.  It is the goal of <?php echo Config::getVal('general', 'site_name'); ?> to provide a one-stop resource for the community, as well as encourage openness, information-sharing, and progress of knowledge.  With that in mind, we will consider listing any site that meets the following requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The site must not encourage exclusivity of information or resources, and must be open with its knowledge, findings, and applications with the rest of the community</li>
		<li>The site must use <?php echo Config::getVal('general', 'site_name'); ?> as its main posting area for releases.  This helps <?php echo Config::getVal('general', 'site_name'); ?> remain the most up-to-date it can be, and serve the community to its fullest potential.</li>
		<li>The site must be honorable and not condone dishonest or underhanded actions such as taking credit for another's work (either on purpose or implied) or harboring negative intentions for another site or resource in the community.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you feel your site meets these requirements, please contact the creator of <?php echo Config::getVal('general', 'site_name'); ?> with your URL so that it can be reviewed.</p>
